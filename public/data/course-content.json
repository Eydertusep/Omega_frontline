    "introduction": "HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the standard markup language for creating the structure and content of web pages, Think of it as the skeleton or blueprint for a webpage. It uses special tags, like <p> for paragraphs and <h1> for headings, to tell the browser how to display the text, images, and other elements on the page.",
    "tags": "These tags act like instructions, telling the browser things like this is a heading, this is a paragraph, or this is an image. By combining these tags and their attributes, you can structure and present information in a meaningful way.",
